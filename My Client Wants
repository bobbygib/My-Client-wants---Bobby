My Client Wants

Hey,

I hope you're doing well.
Just heard from the client.
They're willing to pay us $25/hr to build a site with the following requirements.



-A half-page-height header with a grey background image.
-A 6 column layout with images of their product.
-A short navbar which is always collapsed and slides down to reveal four items
-Lots of animated gifs
-One huge 'buy now' button at the bottom. It should do something fancy when they hover over it.
-A footer with copyright information and a nice picture of the founder.

Is that cool?
Let me know ASAP.
Thanks!
